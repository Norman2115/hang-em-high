    <p class="about-text">This simple web application is a <span class="about-highlight">Hangman-inspired <span
          style="color: #9A8033;">Ma</span><span style="color: #08086d;">lay</span><span
          style="color: #df2d2e;">sia</span>
        history game</span>. Users are able to play two types of
      games: a <span class="about-highlight">question-based</span> game and a <span
        class="about-highlight">word-guessing</span> game.<br /><br />In the <span
        class="about-highlight">question-based
        game</span>, player are presented with a series of multiple-choice questions and must answer within a <span
        class="about-highlight">20</span>-second
      timer. With every correct answer, players increase their <span class="about-highlight">streak</span> with each
      streak boosting their score. But beware
      - the clock is ticking, and the <span class="about-highlight">hangman</span> gets closer with each
      mistake!<br /><br />The
      <span class="about-highlight">word-guessing game</span> is a timed challenge where players try to guess based on
      hints. Players aim to score as high as possible in the least amount of time, with only <span
        class="about-highlight">6</span> attempts before the
      hangman is drawn.<br /><br />Both games have three difficulty levels: <span class="about-highlight">easy</span>,
      <span class="about-highlight">medium</span>, and <span class="about-highlight">hard</span>.
